## Overview

This is an experimental game that I have been working on. I have been using it
to learn webassembly and have been playing around with some game-making concepts
like entity-component systems and graphics.

## Features

## Dependencies

You will need Rust, Cargo, the Rust webassembly target architecture, and Wasm
Pack. You can get the latter two with these commands:

```
cargo install wasm-pack
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
